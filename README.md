# Numerical Tours

Numerical Tours is a collection of Jupyter notebooks covering various algorithmic questions implemented in Python. The repository is organized into two main folders: `maths` and `GIS`.

## Maths:

- Positive Gaussian Process Regressor
- Sampling on the simplex
- Sampling techniques

## GIS:

- Adaptive mesh around a road network
- BD Alti - High-Resolution Elevation Dataset for France
- NetCDF4 compression with xarray
- Rasterizing a larger than memory GPKG file
